# Mapping Open Source in Museums

Welcome to the *Mapping Open Source in Museums* project. This is an effort to understand the use and creation of open source code within the museum community. The project focuses specifically on exploring code written by museums and used by other museums, rather than on museums’s use on other open source projects. It also focuses primarily on sharing done on/through GitHub, and the visualizations and data shown here are pulled from GitHub’s API based on [a running list](data/museums.yml) of museum GitHub accounts.

This project was sparked by [a brief Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/danamuses/status/987411673496498177) in the spring of 2018, and is built in the footsteps of MuseTech Central ([original web version](https://web.archive.org/web/20121130230106/http://musetechcentral.org/), and [GitHub reincarnation](https://github.com/MuseCompNet/muse-tech-central/)), and [Museums on GitHub](https://github.com/Ambrosiani/museums-on-github). This site itself is built on [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), and uses [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) for many of the visualizations.
